# How to Distribute the Room Editor Executable

## What You Have Created

✅ **Standalone Executable**: `RoomEditor.exe` - No Python installation required  
✅ **Easy Launcher**: `RunRoomEditor.bat` - User-friendly startup  
✅ **Complete Package**: All AI models and mutation data included  
✅ **Documentation**: `README.md` with full instructions  

## Distribution Package

The complete package is located in:
```
dist/RoomEditor/
├── RoomEditor.exe          # Main executable (~700MB)
├── RunRoomEditor.bat       # User-friendly launcher
├── README.md              # Complete user guide
└── _internal/             # All dependencies and data
    ├── Data/              # AI models and mutations
    │   ├── best.pt        # Trained VAE model
    │   ├── best_01.pt     # Alternative model
    │   └── Mutations_Extracted/  # Mutation database
    └── [system files]     # Python runtime & libraries
```

## How to Share

### Option 1: ZIP Archive (Recommended)
1. Compress the entire `dist/RoomEditor/` folder into a ZIP file
2. Name it something like `Isaac-AI-RoomEditor-v1.0.zip`
3. Share the ZIP file (will be quite large ~700MB+ due to PyTorch)

### Option 2: Direct Folder
1. Copy the entire `dist/RoomEditor/` folder
2. Share the folder directly
3. Tell users to run `RunRoomEditor.bat`

## User Instructions

Tell your users to:

1. **Download and Extract** the package to any folder
2. **Double-click `RunRoomEditor.bat`** to start
3. **Follow the on-screen instructions**
4. **Play Isaac** and watch the AI generate room variations!

## File Size Notice

⚠️ **Large Package Size**: The executable package will be quite large (~700MB+) because it includes:
- Complete Python 3.13 runtime
- PyTorch deep learning framework
- All mutation bitmap files
- AI model files

This is normal for PyTorch-based applications and ensures users need no additional installations.

## System Requirements for End Users

✅ **Windows 10/11** (64-bit)  
✅ **No Python required**  
✅ **No additional installations needed**  
✅ **~1GB free disk space**  
✅ **Admin permissions** (recommended)  

## Troubleshooting for Users

### If "Windows protected your PC" appears:
1. Click "More info"
2. Click "Run anyway"
3. This happens because the executable isn't digitally signed

### If antivirus flags the file:
- This is common with PyInstaller executables
- Add an exception or whitelist the folder
- The executable is safe (you built it yourself)

### If "tboi_vae module not found":
- This should be fixed in the new build
- If it still appears, basic functionality will work without AI features

## Customization for Distribution

You can modify these files before distributing:
- `RunRoomEditor.bat` - Change the startup messages
- `README.md` - Add your own instructions or credits
- Replace `Data/best.pt` with different AI models

## Testing Before Distribution

Test the executable by:
1. Moving the `dist/RoomEditor/` folder to a different location
2. Running `RunRoomEditor.bat` on a clean machine (if possible)
3. Verifying all features work correctly

- ✅ Works without Python installation
- ✅ Includes all AI functionality
- ✅ Has user-friendly documentation
